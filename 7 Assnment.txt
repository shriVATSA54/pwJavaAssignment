1. Statically typed are the ones where memory allocation for variables happen during compile time ex c,c++,java
   Dynamically typed where memory allocation for variables happen at run time ex-Javascript,python etc
2. Variable is basically a container to hold a value
3. to assign value:     
                                  data_type var_name=value ;
                               ex:  int weight=156;
 4. Primitive data types are the most simplest data type which cannot be further divided.   those are Floatting type,Integer, Character ,Boolean.
5. it is name given to class,objects,packagea nd variables.
6. ther eare 6 types of operators  *Arithematic           *Logical                  *Unary
                                                           * Relational             *Assignment         *Bitwise
7. Increment operator: allows user to increase the value of a variable . can be done by post or pre increment 
       ex: int gae=7;     gae++;  
          System.out.println(gae);        //output 8
     Decrement operator: allows to decreas the value of variable . we have two post and pre
        ex:    int marks=25; 
                       marks=--25;
                        System.out.println(marks) ;                // marks = 24
